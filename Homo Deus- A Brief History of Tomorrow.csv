Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Boy am I glad I am living this day and age rather than 50-100 years from now! Just a coincidence that I happened to watch the first season of Black Mirror on Netflix and I was chilled to think that it may end up that way given how articulately Prof Harari puts it. Humans becoming data points and then dissolving like clumps of mud in the river flow of data. But Homo Sapiens do seem to have a deathwish and this accelerating data driven world may indeed mean the end of Homo Sapiens. Both these books are right up there with the most thought provoking books I have ever read. Prof Harari take a bow - just blows the mid away with the breadth of his knowledge and the expanse of his canvas.
Amazon customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enough is said about the book and the author.. all I can tell is .. if you don't have an imagination or not creative enough this book will be wasted on you .. some things will seem farfetched .. The author is well know to be a Vipassana practitioner.. A lot of those concepts have been added here .. makes sense .. The book came in good shape .. original copy ..
Chitrak Gupta,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the most important book i read in last five years. It traces our confused present to a very probable future when we shall be either extinct or redundant. A book for everyone to read and discuss. The mad rush to the kingdom of Data for incremental happinesses is well decrbed. Where do we go from here? Te book asks this question and leaves humanity to answer or choose oblivion.
Ranajit Banerjee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Same as it's predecessor this book also discusses the workings and logic of the human society as a whole and ponders over what will happen in the near future. Great book for those who love be challenged often. I would also advise to read Sapiens first before reading this book
Abhi,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must read in a lifetime !I took quite sometime to read this because the information and analysis was done over years of study with references from many papers/journals/conferences.Enjoyed the book thoroughly and cheers to Yuval Noah Harari for this masterpiece.Book Quality is great.Delivery on time.
Avtar Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Books : Sapiens and Homo Deus are certainly eye openers for people living in shadows, gives you clear view of how the world came to be as it is today, these two books should be in Top 100 Must Reads, Please buy both of these, do not miss either one, read sapiens first and then deus"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thought provoking. Amazing way of raising controversial and disturbing questions by providing indeniable and well researched historic as well as contemporary proof points. Must read the Sapiens book before reading this one in order to understand the thought process. It expanded and enriched my views of my own life and the world. It has also created a healthy confusion in my mind about our existence and behavior. I intend to work upon it to gain clarity and modify my existence for better.
General customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An excellent account of some of the possible and plausible scenarios of human evolution in near future. The author's analysis of bio engineering, possibility of designer babies combined with algorithm based artificial intelligence and other intelligent technology advances are very lucidly and convincingly presented. The style and manner of the narrative is gripping and the data presented are overwhelming. The hacking of human brain even within the present technological systems and regimes is a scary thought and seems to be already coming true. While the author has not touched upon the topics of dark energy and matter, we dont know what they have in store for us.The book leaves one wondering how our children and grandchildren would navigate this world. Nature and her magic are still completely unpredictable, for every new solution she tends to throw up many more problems. This is a book that must be read by every one to understand where we stand today."
@gtk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Brilliant !. Another great book after Sapiens.Excellent mix of past, present, and future. Different perspectives on many articles. A wide range of possibilities presented about future.It does not have the easy flow like Sapiens, but this one is more ""exciting"" to read."
saswat.s.nayak,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well this book will widen your perspective much like ""Homo sapiens"" did, it should become your bible if you're an atheist although we're all religious in some way or the other according to the definition of religion given by the book :P"

Nirmal Ranganathan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Harari goes on a mind-blowing clinical adventure, almost prophesying a scary future that's sure to demolish all our beliefs of who we are, and our takes on religion, politics, emotions and our very own experiences that have hitherto ruled all our actions. All this is gonna be overruled by the new religion called Dataism that'll change the very basis of our existence.He, however, puts in a nice caveat at the end of the book, saying, ""If you don't like some of these possibilities, you're welcome to think and behave in new ways that will prevent these particular possibilities from materialising.""This book traces the origins of our present-day ideologies and social systems in order to loosen their grip and enable us to act differently and to think in far more imaginative ways about our future.""This treatise is truly an eye-opener to the inevitable transition we humans are going through, probably unconsciously - without an iota of an idea of how we're re-scripting our destiny."
tarun kandwal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Writer starts where he left in sapiens. Book is not as thought provoking as first one. Some of the ideas are extended beyond what they are worth of
ShadowHunter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a profoundly shocking piece of writing, a tactic which Yuval Noah Harari uses to great effect in getting readers to think about society today. The book is ostensibly about the future of mankind, but really is a means of highlighting how current trends in science, technology, humanity etc may progress and asks if that's really how we want things to go. It's philosophy. That big question that has been posed throughout the ages: how should we live? He makes clear that his hypotheses are only potential ways the future might unfold, but the text comes across as a warning as much as anything else.For me, the most interesting and thought-provoking was his argument for the better treatment of animals. While we have placed ourselves at the top of the species ladder, new advents in technology may bring about computer technologies which replace us in the number one spot. Considering we may well end up in the unenviable position of the underdog, perhaps we should take more care of those who, like us, may well depend on the goodwill of this higher in the chain. Not only that, modern technology has increasingly allowed us to understand the emotional and intellectual complexity of animals in a way that should make it difficult to treat them as lesser beings. This is an issue that has been playing on my mind for some time. It seems like every week now we are getting news reports of another animal ripped from its habitat for a selfie and dying as a result. Pictures of intensive farming that have animals in cages so small they can't lay down. My social media newsfeed of animals mistreated, dumped, abused, given no more thought than a piece of trash. Harari is a vegan and his specific set of beliefs come across in the text. Yet, as a current meat eater, it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify my position. I don't know what to do that can help and the book doesn't offer any concrete plans for change, but it has added another dimension to the considerations I have been struggling with myself.Overall though, it is Harari's style which is the most engaging. I rushed though this book because even the most complex issues are dealt with in accessible language and an approachable tone. It's fun and despite the subject matter, doesn't take itself too seriously. It felt like the starting point of a conversation, somewhat controversial of course, but isn't that the best way to get a debate going?"
Ritesh J,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Freakingly thought provoking book!! It talks about the possibilities of how future of mankind may look like - at times this book may seem like a science fiction but Yuval Noah Harrari immediately links his ideas to the present day research progressing towards the possibilities he is talking about.I would have loved to finish this book in one sitting without any interruption!!Harrari explains his very complex ideas in the simplest ways possible and makes the book very interesting. It's horrific and at the same time thrilling to think the way he has narrated the possible extinction of humankind to the new world of superhumans and algorithm. He has touched upon myriad of ideas which makes us think of the cruel practicality of how things work in the world or he law of natural selection works. The book touches upon myriad of philosophical topics covering relationships between science and religion. It also describes how cruel the agricultural revolution is to animals. It reminded me his sentence from his previous book Sapiens that 'History has no justice'.Below are some the ideas he has discussed -1. Humankind has almost solved the problems of famine, plaugue and war. Today more people die due to obesity than malnutrition or wars. Hence the next conquest of humankind is to achieve eternal bliss, immortality and divinity.2. All organisms are just a bio-algorithms.3. Mass medicine or democracy will disappear since the dependence on healthy masses for production, military is being replaced by highly competent algorithms.4. Hence more interest will shift to upgrade the capabilities of few superior beings than to oversee wellbeing of  masses.5. Today medicine is not focused only to cure disease. It focuses to enhance the already healthy life. How will this help sustain the today's liberalism which is based on the presumption that death equals both the riches and pours?6. The liberal solution to social inequality is to give equal value to different human experiences, instead of trying to create the same experience for everyone. However, will this solution work once rich and poor are separated not merely by wealth but also by real biological gaps?7. Dataism is the bew religion.8. It's not freedom of expression but the feeedom of information which holds the most good.9. All organisms are data flows.10. As algorithms reads and understands these data flows better and hence knows humans better than humans themselves, we are giving more powers to these non-conscious algorithms. Hence humans will soon disappear or get downgraded and new generation of super humans will come into force.11. Humankind, as it got stronger, has forced extinction on or downgraded all other species. Exactly the same thing will happen to homo sapiens when algorithms are getting stronger day by day."
Hydlawyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent book , the narrative is just too good , it puts a compulsion on us human beings to think about our existence , our evolution and our future . Are we just an intelligent error of evolution or a part of the larger scheme where as homo sapiens we may outrun our importance just as like any chicken or sheep . Good Reading"
Parth,4.0 out of 5 stars,"While this book can be seen as a sequel to ‘Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind’, it can also be understood without having read Sapiens.The author explains how we have (almost) overcome famine, diseases and wars over the last few centuries. Based on the history, he logically derives that the next agenda of humans would be to defeat death, to achieve everlasting happiness, and to achieve god-like super powers for humans. It may seem very vague when such agenda are depicted here, but the author convinces with very logical arguments that we are already on our way to try to fulfill these new dreams of humanity. The author explores how ‘humanism’ (worship of humans) has become central source of all meaning in this world and what does the future hold in this regard. He explains how the development of latest technologies will make ‘humanism’ nonessential and what will replace it and how the same will impact the humans lives.As in case of ‘Sapiens’, in ‘Homo Deus’ also, you may not agree with many of the author’s views. You will find many of the scenarios of future envisioned by the author horrifying. However, the because of the very rational way in which Yuval has explained his reasoning, the reader will find his views very difficult to reject. Certainly, the book will broaden the horizons of possibilities of future in your mind. The author also clarifies that all the scenarios in this book should be understood as possibilities rather than and prophecies, and you are welcome to behave in ways that will prevent these possibilities to materialise; although it will be difficult to act in that manner."
Vineet harsh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Humans are progressing at a rapid pace and information is at the centre of everything. Big technological companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon are transforming the world by putting all the information at our fingertips and the ability to share it with everyone. This has helped humans remain at the top of the food chain.The author explains this brilliantly as 'Dataism' will be the future religion and the world will be governed by AI and Internet-of-things."
Jai prakash sharma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Again an excellent work by Harari. If you loved Sapiens, you would relish Homo Deus. At times, it doesn't seem as sharp and convincing as Sapiens but that is because the book is about present time which is more likely to be interpreted in more ways than the past. Still this is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the present in a much clearer perspective."
aarushi,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book is interesting , informative but not quite Sapien-class. Now thats what happens when you do a follow-up to a master-piece like Sapiens, Harris' earlier work. Expected it to talk a lot about the future but half-way through the book we're still sort of recapitulating Sapiens and the Past. Nevertheless worth a read."
Bernish Tongbram,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I found the major thrashing of many ""-ism"" with clear relations to it's history quite entertaining and reasonable. At the end, I am left wondering  with a new storm of possibilities inside my head.  Even quoted quite a no. of pages through my read. Instils logical thinking and wakes a questioning self in you on many social behaviours especially dealing with religions."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing book … a must read for everyone. Will question all that you have known and assumed so far. A roller coaster ride through the progression of humanity, from the Neanderthal age, along agricultural revolution, industrial revolution, and the current scientific / technological revolution.Read it! You won't regret it."
indira,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Maybe I should have read Sapiens instead. Homo Deus is interesting, thought provoking, until you lose interest. For one, the author does carry on. He's repetitive and somewhat hectoring. I couldn't finish it."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,This book will make you want the future NOW but will also scare you at certain level. What is our role in the cosmos? Are we just algorithms and data processors? Or is there something more? This book doesnt have the answers but has most of the pertinent questions.
Nitish Thakur,5.0 out of 5 stars,What an amazing sequel to Sapiens. This book covers a wide variety of topics. From the 20th century events to what is around the corner for technology and Artificial intelligence. This book scared the hell out of me while I was reading about the manipulations of AI in later chapters. It is a must read book if you have read Sapiens.
Siddharth,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A decent sequel to outstanding masterpiece Sapiens by Harari. However many times with futuristic prediction and narrow reading of the trends and emerging technology the author seems to grasping at the issues and is not as insightful as Sapiens.Especially work is needed for Artificial intelligence and Biological part of the book, the prognosis on the same given by author seems more than a bit stretched as seem to more based on conjecture than being grounded in evidence.I would recommend skipping this one and buying 21 Challenges for 21st century by the same author, which is better read and has same insightful writing as in Sapiens."
Anusha,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yet another thought provoking masterpiece penned by yuval noah harari. This  book makes the reader to delve over the important issues that might shape the future world and the role of humanity in this changed world- the mission homo sapiens undertakes to achieve longevity, bliss and divinity.  In his natural style he  places his arguments drawing ideas from inter subjective discipline - science, psychology, history, economics, sociology and beautifully weaves his craft in a logical fashion.Thanks"
Adarsh Das Mohapatra,5.0 out of 5 stars,It becomes bit boring in the middle with all its fact but towards the end it again becomes interesting with it's amazing writing and mind-blowing information.
Anand Gupta,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Its a great sequel to Sapiens, yet it doesn't present any major insight. In fact first half is a repetition of Sapiens and rest half is spent expounding his paranoia about a tech-controlled future where most people will be ""useless masses"" and few selected will be riding the tech-tiger that will eventually eat them.Perhaps Yuval needs to spend a few months in Himalayas under guidance of a Vedic teacher to expand his perspective of creation and cosmos."
D.K.Ram,5.0 out of 5 stars,The simplicity of the language yet profound ideas is what makes this book a great read. Revolutionary to think and accept that all of humanity can be reduced to data. From an Indian perspective makes me wonder if centuries old spirituality was way ahead of its times! How will the billions of people not yet connected to the data highway survive this onslaught - answers this book does not provide. Nevertheless makes us think.
Ankit,5.0 out of 5 stars,Book presents multiple dimensions. Makes us to think. However if you are a daily the hindu editorial reader or read good blogs then it may not surprise you too much but it can consolidate the views you yourself have developed while reading editorials and other blogs.
Benu,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A profound and important book, one that will challenge and awaken readers from within and without. The book is absolutely essential reading for all who understand our current global situation and its meaning. The author is clear and lucid as to the dangers that we face.This book was amazing. I have always been very interested in the development of human kind, evolution, and the purpose of life, but I have never been able to find a book that was comprehensive, balanced, and in-depth, that took these different topics, and dealt with them in a meaningful way.One of the best books on evolution ever written."
Varun Warrier,5.0 out of 5 stars,The book provides insight into the bewildering way the modern world works and the role of human beings in it. The book contains neither doomsday predictions nor tales of blind optimism about the future. It's an unbiased look into the forces that led humans to where we are and those that will govern the future of our race.
RaguC,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book have opened so many dimensions in my thought process and thinking. The author very carefully but simply elaborates the various options which can emerge in the future and how it may undermine the existence or requirement of Sapiens in this world.We always believe and have seen so far in history that advancement in technology replaces jobs, but it always depend upon existence of Humans. One job becomes obsolete and creates another, that is how we have seen this world, but author brings in different light. for eg, when bullock carts / horse carts are replaced by cars, the jobs of bullock cart driver becomes obsolete, but comes the new skill and requirement of a car driver.  That is how we have seen the world, but the author asks us to question ourselves, what happened to all the bulls and horses and why it will not happen to Humans?"
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The reason why I gave 5 stars is mainly because this book took me to journey and took my mind to different places ...I surprising realised that some of my habits where and my perspective  about a lot of things were slowly evolving as I read further . I had an amazing time understanding about how gods emerged,how money capitalized(I loved the part where he wrote about why writing and money distinguished people and their standard of living) . I was a Christian and now I'm feeling a little different on religion. I'm a university student and some contents on the book were little hard for me to digest .well anyway I disagree on the homosexuality part...coz I feel awkward about this but since the author wrote a strong statement and argument on liberty and dataism ,I have no points to argue with it but I'm quite surprised  that the author was gay.Anyway...regardless of how data will take out future and artificial intelligence  taking control of our personal decisions ....I am not afraid of anything ...."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"'Sapiens' had a slightly better narrative and was more jam packed with information than this one. even then this one is not to be taken lightly and is defiantly a must read. Information and statics on the current phase of human existence were defiantly eye opening. though most parts of the book seemed blank for me concepts like 'The paradox of Knowledge', 'Psychology and its benefits to strengthen the mind and achieve a higher states of perception' and 'Dataism' certainly expanded my way of thinking. Yuval Noah Harari is certainly one of my most favorite modern thinkers."
N_S,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This book will turn your preconceived ideas upside down and throw them out of the window. Eye opener, revolutionary and way ahead of its time as well. Yuval Noah Harari is miles ahead of the rest of us when it comes to defining our human past, present and future."
aarti,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have purchased this book after reading ""Homo Sapiens: brief history of mankind"" which I absolutely loved for content and great insights on human journey from insignificant apes to sapiens ruling the world.This book on the other hand is not what at first glance may look like(Predication) , in reality, it counts all possibility from logical prospective of what humans of tomorrow(Homo deus) would live like. This book starts with utopian idea that sapiens have accomplished to overcome today's malignancy (not to mention affluent world) and what will there focus be like.I strongly advice anyone with great appetite  for knowledge and curiosity to read this. Surely a must read book."
R P Sahu,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The book speculates about future of humankind. Some humans, according to the Author, will become like Gods. But many will become a part of ""useless"" class. Interesting book, worth a read."
Chaitanya Vishal N,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The analysis and hard work done by Dr. Harari is monumental and raises some very important questions concerning the fate of humanity. I believe this book will be referred to in the days to come. In short, an outstanding book which will stimulate your intellectual side."
Smit Kolhe,5.0 out of 5 stars,There can not be a lesser rating for this book than a perfect book. Its not only a book but efforts taken by the author and his coworkers in getting those many fatcs together in a single book. It would have taken me to read 100 history and science books to get this much information.Salute to you Yuval Noah Harari... Looking forward to read more of you.
