He's immersed in hope-- hope that he'll find Daisy, hope that she'll come to him in the end, but what happens in the end? Does he really achieve that dream?Throughout the novel, Fitzgerald shows people at various stages of pursuing their dream of something, be it wealth or love or success of some kind. Are they happy? Have they really achieved what they set out to achieve? Or are they like Gatsby's books in his library: to appear as if the owner is erudite and well-read, but upon closer examination, un-opened and un-readAbout me:NovelsI can help you to buy novels at it's lowest price as I keep all the details of it on different days including Amazon great Indian sell,Prime day offer, lightening sell,Diwali sell etc. e.g A Thousands of Splendid Suns rate was like this 399_1/7,424_3/7,290_3/7,②0⑨_8/7,but i bought this at 290...from 424₹ to 209₹ you can understand how it differs in price..

divya Kishore,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book was quite different from what I expected it to be.The opulent world does not completely consume you but it surely does give you a lot to think about.Jay Gatsby is a character to remember by all the people who fall in love. It speaks a lot about social prejudice, if one is keen about reading in between the lines. The narrator (Nick Carraway), has a peculiarly skeptic way of keeping your attention.All in all it is a good read."
Mohammad Faizan Khan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have you read this epic piece of classic till now, or watched the movie based upon it's plot? Luckily, don't know how but I didn't watch the movie so I read the novel straightway. I picked it couple of days ago and finished reading it joyfully but now I'm going to enjoy the movie. Onething, I want to make sure that if you compare the books from Movies (based on same plot), always Books go ahead on the way, coz of imagination (for readers), way of narration, detailed plot and many more.* Book Recommendation *~The Great Gatsby- By F. Scott Fitzgerald.""I hope she'll be a fool -- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.""~The great fiction writer of American history and epic classic novel of all time. The book is full pack of classic fiction, romance, and a bit of everything you want to have in a perfect book for smooth read. The story revolves around the protagonist, a graduate who served in the war from the west and worked as a novel's narrator, and a great mysterious character, Gatsby.""Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.""~Strongly recommend to every reader who wants to pick the next classic fiction for great piece of literature and narration."
SHIVANI,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice book
Hitesh kumawat,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Over drinks, I’ve observed—like so many smart alecks—that much of The Great Gatsby’s popularity relies heavily on its shortness. At a sparse 180 pages, Fitzgerald’s masterpiece could be argued to be the “Great American novella.” Gatsby, like so many other short classics, is easily readable, re-readable, and assessable to everyone from the attention-deficient young to mothers juggling a kid, a career, and a long-held desire to catch up on all those books “they should have read but haven’t gotten around to yet”.I’ve now read Gatsby three times, and I admit that on my first reading during (like handfuls of others) my senior year English class, I wasn’t particularly fond of the book; I believe I used the adjective “overrated” on numerous occasions. Daisy Buchanan seemed like a twit of a woman, and I found Jay Gatsby to be pathetically clawing in his attempt to attain her. Nick, my guide, only annoyed me further with his apparent hero-worshiping of a man I found one-dimensional and his adoration for the kind of woman I’ve seen other men purport to be goddesses, but in fact, are dim-witted simpletons with nice figures.Over my two subsequent readings—pushed along by friends whose judgment I trusted and who swore the book was “so funny and ironic”—I discovered within Fitzgerald’s fable a sardonic social wit and a heavily layered critique of the American Dream: the poor, working (wo)man rising above his or her social situation to discover money conquers all.Fitzgerald has a discerning ability for sharp critiques of the economically privileged and, like Jane Austin, has an ear for realistic, bantering dialogue. Through Nick’s narration, we see a world that so many Americans dream of (its enviableness only further accentuated by our open disdain for it): a life of endless parties, delicious food, beautiful clothes, and Paris Hilton. Nick who’s paradoxically drawn to his cousin, Daisy’s, and her husband, Tom’s, lifestyle with gloating contempt echoes the contemporary American idolization of an elite lifestyle that none but a select few attain.We watch Daisy with her voice that “sounds of money” flit about with uncompromising shallowness and vivacious school-girl frivolity, and through her, see so many of the inconsequential remarks and actions others (as well as ourselves) have made for the sheer sake of “having a good time”. In spite of her frivolity and weak disposition, we become, like Gatsby, “overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.”Through Gatsby’s veneration of Daisy, we not only imagine what so many Americans desire (success), but also we see the goal and glittering fixation of all humanity: beauty. And like many Americans in the throes of Capitalism, Gatsby believes that money can buy beauty as well as love. Fitzgerald articulates this disillusion with haunting force, particularly voiced through Nick’s obsessive repulsion with the extravagant society his social status has allowed him and the sadness he finds while watching a “working man” attempt to enter it.One critique of The Great Gatsby, which could also be argued as a positive, is the limited scope of action and themes Fitzgerald chooses to encapsulate. We only see the wealthy elite (or people wanting to be the wealthy elite), and only Nick really has any depth of characterization. Unlike a tome, such as War and Peace, Gatsby fails to have numerous interwoven plotlines within a grand historical context. Yes, the Jazz Age is the novel’s backdrop, but Fitzgerald fails to engage in any discussion beyond a summer among the wealthy youth partying into the wee hours of the night in the West Egg. Yet, the control with which Fitzgerald expresses his limited themes makes the novel’s lack of scope forgivable.Gatsby is short and easily accessible, and I have no doubt these aspects of the novel do lend to its everlasting popularity. At the same time, it should never diminish its truly admirable ability to tease apart some of the most confounding qualities American culture values: money, beauty, youth, hard work, and the ever effusive, love."
Ayisha Thakkar,3.0 out of 5 stars,Well the first thing which i liked about this book was it keep its readers engaged till the end..To know how you need to read this book...i didnt find Gatsby that interesting in respect to the suspense which was created in the beginning of the novel.. Also not much incidents occured till we reach the end .. Its d diction;narrative style & beautiful description by the writer which keeps the reader engaged to the story.. Not a big love story though.. Beautifully depicts the then culture & society...overall its a beautiful art..

Amit Bharti,5.0 out of 5 stars,"An enthusiastically penned down in 20th century story with a gold platted and flourished with every lavish lifestyle on Earth. A story whose plot based in New York City and some of its deep past belongs to World War scenario. ""Over the great bridge, the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its firstwild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world."".The author has portrayed the narration through Nick Carraway's observation. Daisy, a most charismatic lady of Louisville. Story has impeded around her confronting two gentlemen Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby. This is where all story sums up in most appeasing way. How this all get entangled in the summer of West Coast to East Egg.Nick's second cousin Daisy got married with Tom Buchanan in Chicago and for some reason they came to settle in East Coast. As we proceed, the story becomes tempting and get into an inevitable twist. Jay Gatsby is the major character of this story as he has shown with great and an inherited royalty but story deems to somewhere else..How this story shows that wealth can't get everything that what you want to make and on the side it greatly depicts with serene depth that what exactly matters and plays great role in human life either it is about Idealism or Materialism..I like the narration and detailed writing as author has penned so many things with such a grace that one can't left this book in between. Climax is really what the current era fiction books lacks. It diverts and make one to feel that sometimes it's hard to erase past and move forward in life.In my attempt of reading as I am non fiction reader I tend to look more about lesson and live to read and extract the hidden meanings from between the lines. My major focus was on Gatsby that his unconditional love brought him to a place where he would never expected."

APRATIM MUKHERJEE,3.0 out of 5 stars,"This is an American literary classic about five major characters(out of which one,Nick Carraway,is the narrator).Jay Gatsby is the focal point of the story.A blossoming romance,loneliness in a crowd,old romantic sparks etc. make up the story.The narrative is flat but there are points of excitement where a reader cannot put down the book.Gatsby's description by Jordan kills the interest as one nears the end.There are many instances like this which make this work look like an EEG graph.But,its time to make a literary confession.I am helpless because I read a classic but didn't understand it well.The reason for that being the amount of knowledge my brain has about 1920's USA.I know little about Jazz and uptown New York.I find myself closer to characters of British classics.In my opinion,if one knows very little about New York,he shouldn't pick this book.For others,it will be a classic.A classic book with a selective reader base is worth three stars out of five as far as I am concerned."
TIRU,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The novel needs little introduction as it has gone as one of the greatest romantic classics of English or atleast American literature. But the FP publisher is so unprofessional that they haven't even read the copy before publishing it. There are many punctuation issues. Many places misses comma and full-stops. Few times I kept wondering what sense the author is trying to make and switched to my Kindle copy of the same to know that there was a full-stop missing. Please go for better publishing house. Although FP is cheap, it comes at a comprise."
Kuheli M.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved the book and if you want, then you can read the spoiler below!!..“The Great Gatsby” by F Scott Fitzgerald is one of the greatest American novels of the 20TH century. This book is based on the life of Jay Gatsby. The narrator, Mr. Carraway describes the life of Mr. Gatsby, a very different type of rich man. The New York times have defined it to be a curious book.The story starts as the narrator decides to go to the East. There, he lives at the East Egg and coincidentally, his neighbor is Jay Gatsby, the richest man at that area. Mr. Carraway meets his cousin, Daisy and her husband, Tom Buchanan who has been cheating on her with Mrs. Wilson. He also meets Miss Baker. There, he lives at the East Egg and coincidentally, his neighbor is Jay Gatsby, the richest man at that area. He notices that every night, a party is thrown out at Gatsby’s place, where everybody is welcomed, even those who are not invited (cuz he doesn’t want to feel lonely).One day, Mr. Gatsby himself had come next door to invite Mr. Carraway to his party that night. Nick Carraway, not knowing who Gatsby was, misunderstood him for being his chauffeur. Gatsby then asks for Nick’s help and tells him to talk to Jordan Baker. Jordan then tells him that daisy and Gatsby knew and loved each other, and asks him to help them meet each other.The next day, Daisy and Gatsby meet each other and starts spending time together. Unfortunately, Tom got to know about their affair. Soon later, Mrs Wilson dies in a car accident as Daisy was driving at a greater speed and Gatsby takes the blame on himself. Tom gets into depression and blames Gatsby for everything! Not too late, Gatsby dies and his mansion became a silent place..Delivery was good and I also got a free bookmark!!That's all!! Hope you have a lovely day!"
stephy simon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb book . A simple journey to the life of mr gatsby through the eyes of his neighbor ,the narrator. He was a party love ,living full of life on fst part of the story . Later on we could see that he was all alone on the crowd.When saying about the quality of the paper ,I got fingerprint classics edition and the paper printing n cover is superb ."
Bewitchingly Paranoid,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Finished this one a couple of weeks back. One thing I couldn’t understand, why was Gatsby so, so, so anxious about meeting Daisy. Also, with that, I want to know what was the thing between Nick and Gatsby. It's like, he is fascinated by him but on the other hand, there were few things about Gatsby that used to annoy Nick.What I am liking is the craziness of Jordan. But with that, Tom is crazy. How can he be with other girls when he is still married to Daisy? Gosh! I found it a little slow till it reached chapter 4 but things are turning up now. What I can say for sure is Nick is completely flabbergasted with whatever is going around him, be it Tom Buchanan's or Gatsby or Wilson"
Farheen Nilofer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"As for the physical attributes the quality of the book is far more than price.This book is a must for everyone. No matter how hard you try love can't be bought. You cannot live for only one dream you should have to have options open.Moral sense of genuiness , sympathy and guilt are qualities of good people. These are the parameters through which you can weight person's character. These are the attributes which draw the line for being human."
Wini Alfred Pereira,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!!!! Got it for 43rs! Seriously nowadays u dnt even get a mac burger for that money.The coverpage of the book is such nice quality and even the font and pages are good. What more do u want for 43Rs? First even i was doubtful about the quality coz of the price.. But just go for it. A must own book!!! Talking about the story plot: - MARVELLOUS WORK!!!!!
Deep,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Heard lot about this book, and after reading I agreed those who referred it to me.you throw parties just thinking that someday the girl once you loved would come somehow. You become rich for someone; all this with the writing if FITSZERALD. The very first page tells it is going to be a book that will be retain in emory fora long time."
Reading_Tam_Ishly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I loved the writing. I didn't actually like or hate the book. The characters are really unlikable.I enjoyed the read while it last.I enjoyed the charismatic character of Gatsby. I enjoyed the mystery and all the drama till the end.Overall it was a good one time read.*Highlight of the read:The amazing romantic lines! If I ever reread this book, it will be for these few particular lines"
Gaurav,5.0 out of 5 stars,"i have been thinking of reading this for a while, however didnt get the opportunity. You try to pushback on classics when there is so much new content available. But i was wrong.this was one of the best classics i have read so far, just like Animal fARM.Kept me glued to finish before picking anything else.About the book: JD has done justice with portraying Holden's character during those times. Anyone and everyone would be able to relate to him either in self misery or as a friend of someone who was like Holden. His journey of a few days has been encapsulated in a few hundred pages so astonishingly, that it takes the reader to 40s. Hope i could read more like these on my weekends."
Shreya Joshi,3.0 out of 5 stars,
Rohan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Delivery is very fast.  But this book has many pages partially un printed.As I've started reading it and a interesting book,  so I'm not returning it.  One of the page just for reference."
Vignesh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Gatsby! One of the greates classic novel of all times, the story justifies the title. The life of Mr.Gatsby teaches thd value of relationship and friendship. It also proves that not every people deserves a genyinely loving person. Also I liked the Nick Carraway character, only person who knows completely about Gatsby and stood by him till the end."
Sravani Katta,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A magnificent novel on every level. Fitzgerald takes us to the Jazz age focusing on the story of Gatsby and Daisy. Although the book takes a slow approach, in the beginning, the fast-paced scenes in the middle and end flip out a love story into a tragedy that keeps anyone engaged.I find some parts to be overly descriptive and the cut from one scene to another in each paragraph might seem a little hard to follow up. 50+ adjectives to describe a street? Duh! Nonetheless, it is a must-read."
KRUNAL JADAV,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Boring and confusing story. Why It's a classic? Just because others are praising, I can't say it a good one. May be I'm in minority who don't like it, But it's my opinion. It's ok if you like it."
சதீஷ்குமார்,5.0 out of 5 stars,Initially after reading haven’t felt much.... then I watched the movie and read again....  then I felt the connect.....Now I understand why this book Is loved by everyone....According to me this story is an absolute epic and must read......About the print... this book is well printed and more than worth for this 79rupees.....I would suggest the readers to take the print of the map of the Long Island (great Gatsby version) and start the book.....
Amazon buyer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"There's no introduction or recommendation needed for this book. Albeit I wanted to install some feedback in the seller's and amazon's bag. The price for this book is the most affordable anyone could ask for,but in spite being the price so low there's no compromise with the quality or delivery of the product. I received the book just as fresh and the delivery man was quite prompt too. Being a devoted bibliophile, amazon has been my long run companion in decorating my library with the best quality books yet at a supportive price. Thankyou"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I honestly bought this book after hearing about it from many of the famous book bloggers but was still not sure whether to buy this or not since the price of this book was quite low as compared to other best sellers.I was in a doubt until I read this great great book!Honestly, I was mesmerized! The book ended leaving me in awe.So in case you are looking for something that would be an apple to your eye in such a low price, go for it.classics like these are rare."
Camelia,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Got it in Amazon sale but on the second very page the printing is vanished. Very disappointed. If that is why it was at discount then charge full , give a book with full prints otherwise how can now I read the first para it self. :("

Amazonuser,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is classic for a reason... I loved the writing style. The author has written the mindset of that generation of the great war and depression of that generation it is such and astonishing and interesting read
Abhay Kushwaha,5.0 out of 5 stars,I had seen a part of movie before i started the book.So while reading I was imagining all characters the way I have seen in the movie.
Sunaina,3.0 out of 5 stars,I was actually  waiting for this book to recieve because i had heard so much about this book and wanted to get one for me.first frw pages i found little diffcult to get in to it..it took little time to understand  and get in to the story..
Anuj Sharma,3.0 out of 5 stars,A classic novel which should be read atleast once. The writing style is excellent. The story isn’t that impressive but has been told really well nevertheless.

readaholic,2.0 out of 5 stars,Book reached on time but it was totally folded from the right top corner. I like my new books in new and perfect condition.Not impressed and not happy.
Kashika Srivastava,3.0 out of 5 stars,It is a nice story about the greatness of jay gatsby. It will make you wonder about humanity and question this ideology that whether still good results are reaped for good deeds or is it nothing more than a myth ?
kamalsanjana,4.0 out of 5 stars,A best romatic book and its shows the 19th century lifestyle of American. But the story is not get by all because it not just a romatic book although it tell the lifestyle of a rich persons in america at1922.
